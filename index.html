                <h2>About Us</h2>
                <p>Openness, accountability, and honesty define government transparency. In a free society,
                    transparency is government's obligation to share information with citizens. It is at the
                    heart of how citizens hold their public officials accountable. Here at <abbr title="Transparent Government in Fact">TGIF</abbr> we believe that
                    government should be transparent.</p>
                <p>Governments exist to serve the people. Information on how officials conduct the public
                    business and spend taxpayer money must be readily available and easily understood. This
                    transparency allows good and just governance. Transparency promotes accountability and
                    provides information for citizens about what their Government is doing.</p>
                <p>We also believe that government should be participatory. Public engagement enhances the
                    Government's effectiveness and improves the quality of its decisions. Knowledge is widely
                    dispersed in society, and public officials benefit from having access to that dispersed
                    knowledge. We invite you to use our site to become actively engaged in American government.
                </p>

                <p><abbr title="Transparent Government in Fact">TGIF</abbr> works to disclose information in forms that the public can readily find and use. We
                    solicit public feedback to identify information of greatest use to the public.</p>

                    <h3>Background History of Government Transparency</h3>
                    <p>In the West, the idea that government should be open to public scrutiny and susceptible
                        to public opinion dates back at least to the time of the Enlightenment, when many
                        philosophes made an attack on absolutist doctrine of state secrecy, a core part of their
                        intellectual project. The passage of formal legislative instruments to this end can also be traced to
                        this time with Sweden, for example, (which then included Finland as a Swedish-governed
                        territory) enacting free press legislation as part of its constitution (Freedom of the
                        Press Act, 1766). This approach, and that of the philosophes more broadly, is strongly related
                        to recent historiography on the eighteenth-century public sphere.

                        <p>Influenced by Enlightenment thought, the revolutions in America (1776) and France
                            (1789), freedom of the press enshrined provisions and requirements for public budgetary
                            accounting and freedom of the press in constitutional articles. In the nineteenth
                            century, attempts by Metternichean statesmen to row back on these measures were
                            vigorously opposed by a number of eminent liberal politicians and writers, Bentham,
                            Mill and Acton prominent among the latter.</p>

                        <p>Open government is widely seen to be a key hallmark of contemporary democratic
                            practice
                            and is often linked to the passing of freedom of information legislation.
                            Scandinavian
                            countries claim to have adopted the first freedom of information legislation, dating
                            the
                            origins of its modern provisions to the eighteenth century and Finland continuing
                            the
                            presumption of openness after gaining independence in 1917, passing its Act on
                            Publicity
                            of Official Documents in 1951 (superseded by new legislation in 1999).</p>

                        <p>The United States passed its Freedom of Information Act (<abbr title="Freedom of Information Act">FOIA</abbr>) in 1966, <abbr title="Freedom of Information Act">FOIA</abbr>s, Access
                            to
                            Information Acts (<abbr title="Access Information Act">AIA</abbr>s) or equivalent laws were passed in Denmark and Norway in
                            1970.
